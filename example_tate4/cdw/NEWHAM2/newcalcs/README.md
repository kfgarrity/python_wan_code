# Unfolding projections

Here I am trying projections of the unfolded SOC band structure.

The projections are 

- 0 = All Ta
- 1 = All Te
- 2 = Ta d_z^2
- 3 = Te p_z

There are fermi surface projections

fermi_unfold_cdw_2d_KY_is_0.0_kx_kz_50_fermi_0.0proj_1.pdf

refers to kx kz plnae, ky = 0.0, Fermi energy of 0.0 eV, projection number 1 (All Te).

I also unfold the band structure:

I'm working on the surface projections
